# Overview

This directory provides Zaza test definitions and bundles to verify basic
deployment functionality from the perspective of this charm, its requirements
and its features, as exercised in a subset of the full OpenStack deployment
test bundle topology.

Run the smoke tests with:

```bash
cd ../
tox -e build
tox -e func-smoke
```
